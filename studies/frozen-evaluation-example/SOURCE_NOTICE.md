**Modification notice — 2026-09-24, Dylan Stechmann project:** the derived
feature table samples nonoverlapping phase-image tiles, computes nine numerical
descriptors, and measures nuclear mask area fractions. Prediction tables,
metrics and a figure were subsequently computed from that table. These are
new analyses, not NIST results or endorsements. Source TIFFs were not modified
and are not redistributed here. No source software or trained weights were
copied. The repository's MIT license covers its original code; the NIST source
terms below apply to the source data and must accompany their derivatives.

The dataset's license points to [NIST's data terms](https://www.nist.gov/open/license).
